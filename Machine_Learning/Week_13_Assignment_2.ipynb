    "    Reducing overfitting is crucial in machine learning to ensure that a model generalizes well to new, unseen data rather than just memorizing the training data. Here are some common strategies to mitigate overfitting:\n",

    "__1. More Data:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "    Increasing the size of the training dataset can help the model capture a broader range of patterns in the data and reduce overfitting.\n",
